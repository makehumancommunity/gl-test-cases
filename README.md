# gl-test-cases
Various short code snippets for testing OpenGL.

## Existing test cases so far

* 00 *Does pyopengl work at all?* - Just show a basic cube to see if pyopengl crashes early
* 01 *Does does opengl with pyqt4 work?* - Bare mininum for gl with pyqt4
* 02 *Does does opengl with pyside work?* - Bare mininum for gl with pyside
* 03 *Does does opengl with pyqt5 work?* - Adapted from the pyqt4 example, something is probably still missing.
